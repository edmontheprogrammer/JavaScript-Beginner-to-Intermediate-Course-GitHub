// variables cannot be a reserved keyword 
// variable names should be meaningful 
// variable names cannot start with a number such as 1name 
// Variable names cannot contain a space or hyphen (-), multiple words 
// --- variable names should be  doen using camel case notations or joined 
// --- using underscores
// variable names are case-sensitive
// There are two ways to declare multiple variables: 
//--- 1. you can declare multiple variable on one line and separate them with comma
//--- 2. Modern best practice is to declare each variable in a single line.
