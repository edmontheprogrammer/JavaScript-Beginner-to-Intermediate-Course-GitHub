// JavaScript is a dynamic type language
// There are two types of programming languages: Static (Statically typed)
// and dynamic (dynamically typed) language. 
// In static langauges when we declare a variable, the type of the variable
// is set and it cannot be changed in the future.
// Example of declaring a varible in static langauge, string name = 'John'; 
// In a dynamic language like JavaScript, the type of a variable can be change
// at run time. Example of declaring a variable in dynamic langauge, 
// let name = 'John'; 
// Unlike static languages the type of these variables will be determined at 
// runtime based on the values that we assigned to them. 
// In JavaScript, we don't have different types of numbers such as float, integers and long
// all numbers are of type number data type. 

// Note; undefined is a type in JavaScript, and undefined is also a value in JavaScript. 
// Note 2; selectedColor is a type of Object. 

let name = 'Bob'; // String Literal 
let age = 7; // Number Literal 
let isApproved = true; // Boolean Literal 
let firstName; // undefined 
let selectedColor = null;
